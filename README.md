# Flovatar
## Pre-made is so last month, now you can become the creator!
Instead of collecting pre-generated assets, with Flovatar you can unleash your creativity - no more trade-off between rarity and your own individuality.

You can decide if you want to build a Flovatar that looks just like you, or even better, something that speaks to you with the rarest traits combination! With 11 components, there are over 100 billion unique variations!

# Contribute
This repository contains code for contracts, scripts and transaction associated with [Flovatar](https://flovatar.com/) project. Take a look around and if you have ideas how to make it better - we welcome it with open heart! :hearts:

# Integration
Our contracts are deployed to both networks:
- `Mainnet` - **0x921ea449dffec68a** - [Flow View Source - Flovatar Account](https://flow-view-source.com/mainnet/account/0x921ea449dffec68a)
- `Testnet` - **0x9392a4a7c3f49a0b** - [Flow View Source - Flovatar Account](https://flow-view-source.com/testnet/account/0x9392a4a7c3f49a0b)

## Basic Example
You can use code in [get_flovatars.cdc](/scripts/get_flovatars.cdc) file to get a list of Flovatars living in account's storage. 
```cadence
/// Fetch a List of Flovatars on address - Mainnet
import Flovatar from 0x921ea449dffec68a

access(all) fun main(address:Address) : [Flovatar.FlovatarData] {
  return Flovatar.getFlovatars(address: address)
}
```
```js
import { query, config } from "@onflow/fcl";

config().put("accessNode.api", "https://rest-mainnet.onflow.org");

(async()=>{
  const getFlovatars = async (address) => {
    // We will inline code from above here
    const cadence = `
      import Flovatar from 0x921ea449dffec68a

      access(all) fun main(address:Address) : [Flovatar.FlovatarData] {
        return Flovatar.getFlovatars(address: address)
      }
    `;
    
    // script expects single argument of type Address
    const args = (arg, t) => [arg(address, t.Address)];
    
    // ...and we are ready to query the network! :)
    const flovatars = await query({ cadence, args });
    
    console.log({ flovatars })
  }
  
  const user = "0x2a0eccae942667be"
  await getFlovatars(user)
})()
```

Example code on how it could be used together with [FCL-JS](https://github.com/onflow/fcl-js) library can be found on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/dev-to-fcl-05-list-flovatars-at-address-0bibcd)
